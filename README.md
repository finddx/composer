# {composer}

{composer} is an R package which contains a Shiny app for building and analysing composite indicators.

# About

Composite indicators are aggregations of multiple indicators into a single composite score. They are typically used to measure multidimensional socio-economic concepts
such as innovation, quality of life, and so on. Often they are used to rank and compare countries and regions, either for advocacy or for prioritisation or to help
direct the resources of international organisations.

The [COINr](https://github.com/bluefoxr/COINr) package is an R package designed to help build and analyse composite indicators. The objective of this repo is to develop
a Shiny app which provides a user-friendly interface with the COINr package, allowing non-R users to build and visualise composite indicators.

A development version of the app should soon be hosted (LINK TO ADD).
