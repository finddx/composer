# Bubble chart {#sec-bubble}

The bubble chart, which is found in the "Bubble" sub-tab of the "Explore" tab group, is a powerful tool to compare the relationships between indicators and aggregates.

*More details explaining the purpose*

The sidebar gives various controls. The first four dropdown menus control which indicators or aggregates to display on the plot.

The bubble chart is an "enhanced" scatter plot. You can select any indicator or aggregate to plot on the x and y axes, but also each point can be sized and coloured by third and fourth variables. After selecting the variables of interest, click the "Run" button.

*Anna I leave to you to pad this out?*

The other controls in the sidebar allow further adjustments. The two "Threshold" boxes can be used to draw horizontal and vertical lines on the plot which can represent thresholds.

It is also possible to filter units based on grouping variables (see again @sec-datainput), and to highlight selected countries.
